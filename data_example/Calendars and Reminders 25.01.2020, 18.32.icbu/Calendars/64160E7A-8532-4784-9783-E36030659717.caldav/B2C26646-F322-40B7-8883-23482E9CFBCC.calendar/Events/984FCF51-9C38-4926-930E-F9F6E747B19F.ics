LOCATION:Clarendon Laboratories\nParks Road\, Oxford\, OX2\, England
DESCRIPTION:As if I had planned it\, I have just received the official i
 nvitation. As mentioned this morning\, we should aim to meet at 10 am at
  the entrance to the Clarendon Laboratory. I recommend that you google t
 he lecturers – my initial comments are as follows –\n \nProfessor James 
 Binney is a bit of a legend in Oxford. He tried to teach me mathematics 
 when I was at Magdalen many years ago. He will explain the contrast betw
 een the Newtonian view and the Einsteinian view that we touched on this 
 morning – probably hard in places.\n \nProfessor Subir Sarkar is a very 
 gifted lecturer. He will guide us through the principles of interferomet
 ry\, from the original Michelson-Morley experiment to the extraordinaril
 y evolved LIGO and VIRGO. There may well be some nasty mathematics at th
 e end.\n \nThe third lecture\, by Professor John March-Russell\, is like
 ly to be the most difficult and controversial\, as string theory is invo
 lved. If you are struggling towards the end\, then please remember that 
 you are not a string quintet and refreshments are only a few minutes awa
 y!\n \nJAG\n\n
