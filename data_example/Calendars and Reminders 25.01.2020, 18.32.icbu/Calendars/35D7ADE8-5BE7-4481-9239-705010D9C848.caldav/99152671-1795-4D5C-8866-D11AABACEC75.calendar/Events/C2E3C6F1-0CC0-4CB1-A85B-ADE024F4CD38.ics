  Jones over the Easter break.\n\nHe is available on the following dates\
 ;- 30/31st March and the week commencing 3rd April (excluding the Friday
 ).\n\nIf possible we would like to get an idea from Mr. Tudur Jones the 
 timetable for removal of the pins etc from Freddie’s ankle. Ideally Fred
 die would like to postpone this operation until July/August (so that it 
 does not interrupt his school studies/exams). However\, we have some con
 cerns that this may be too late in the process of healing in which case 
 we would have to look at getting them removed in the Easter break. Your 
 urgent reply on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nMany th
